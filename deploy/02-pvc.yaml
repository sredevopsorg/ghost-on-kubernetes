  # With ReadWriteMany, you can have multiple replicas of Ghost, so you can achieve high availability.
  # Note that ReadWriteMany is not supported by all storage providers and may require additional configuration.
  # Ghost officialy doesn't support HA, they suggest using a CDN or caching. Info: https://ghost.org/docs/faq/clustering-sharding-multi-server/
